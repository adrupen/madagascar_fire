# Wildfire Monitoring and Fire Danger Forecasts in Madagascar

Mobile Web application for in-situ reports on wildfires in Madagascar.

### Background

Wildfires continue to present a major risk in many countries. It is estimated that nearly 400 million hectares of natural areas are burnt every year, causing loss of life, tremendous environmentaland economic damage, and contributing to the increase of carbon emissions worldwide.

The Madagascar Fire Report App brings together existing GEOSS information sources at regional and national level to provide a comprehensive view and evaluation of fire patterns and effects at a global level.

The performance and impact of Copernicus should be further increased by meaningfully integrating non-European data and services. This is especially true for necessary in-situ data outside of Europe. For this purpose, international cooperation should be sought, the establishment of which can be supported by the international Group on Earth Observations (GEO).

### About the app

The Madagascar Fire Report App is a ready to use mobile web application that allows park rangers in Madagascar to easily report information about a recent wildfire. The mobile web app provides a very simple and mobile friendly interface, allowing the park ranger to carry out their work in the field. Input parameters are provided as sliders with pictograms for easy understanding and inputting that also allows non-english speakers to use the interface.

Active fire hotspots (last 24hrs, 48hrs and 72hrs) from the NASAâ€™s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) can be visualized on the map as well Web Mapping Services (WMS) from GEO providers within the GEO Discovery Access Broker (GEO DAB) e.g. the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Radiation Data over Africa "JADE".
In total the Madagascar Fire Report Appp can harvest 25.225.230 national and global WMS (June 2018).

In-situ wildfire report by the park ranger is uploaded to GEOSS, allowing anyone to take part in the information.

The Madagascar Fire Report App not only strengthens international cooperation with GEOSS but also provide accurate information on fire activity in Madagascar. But in fact, this real-time monitoring app could be used also in other fire-prone regions anywhere in the world.
