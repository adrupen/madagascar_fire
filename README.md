# Madagascar Fire Report app
Web application for in-situ reports on fires in Madagascar.

The goal was to provide a ready to use web application that allows park rangers in Madagascar to easily report information about a recent fire.
The web app provides a very simple and mobile friendly interface, allowing the park ranger to carry out their work in the field.
Input parameters are provided as sliders with pictograms for easy understanding and inputting that also allows non-english speakers to use the interface.

In addition park rangers can visualize the recent fires for Madagascar on the map (last 24hrs, 48hrs and 72hrs) and they can display datasets (Web Mapping Services) from GEOSS which might be relevant for their report.

Data collected is uploaded to the GEOSS platform, allowing anyone to take part in the information.
